## Deploying your own website with GitHub
Before you get started, some preliminary steps:
  1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)!
  2. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This is cross-platform, so it'll work on Linux, Windows OS, and macOS!
  3. Install Visual Studio Code!

Setting up your own website on GitHub:
  1. Create an `index.html` file. (The tool we're using, GitHub Pages, requires a file named `index.html`)
  2. Create a **new** GitHub repository by clicking the "+" sign next to your avatar in the top-right corner of the page. Or, go to https://github.com/new.
     1. Name your repository `<username>.github.io`, where `<username>` is your actual GitHub username. So e.g if your username is neoncitylights, it should be called `neoncitylights.github.io`.
     2. Make the repository public.
     3. Skip everything and click "Create repository".
  3. Click the button that says "Setup in Desktop": ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4723983/192112740-493ba307-f30b-4d0a-8836-a0648875c2b5.png)
     * You might see a dialog that says something like below. Check the checkbox and press "Open Link". <img width="387" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4723983/192112851-e7ecf180-c7a0-411e-aef0-d6203ce8a07a.png">

  4. Move your files into the same repository! 
  5. Type in a message to describe your change, and press "Commit to main". Then, press "Publish branch". The workflow should look similar to this GIF: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4723983/192112923-35bcec44-ce35-40ea-9c9b-e51240030740.png)
  6. Open up your browser again and visit `https://*username*.github.io` (but with your actual username!)
